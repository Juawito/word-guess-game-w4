## About 

The folllowing application is a Dynamically created page.  
It uses javascript to create the questions, highscore form and list.  
It also utilizes local storage to save all previous highscores and renders it to the page. 

## Creating the page
To create the page I started five functions that will handle keeping track of the time, score, highscores, and creating all the elements on the page.  
I then created two buttons.  
    1. One on the home page to start the quiz  
    2. The second one to submit the users initials and score to be saved on the page.  
I kept the color scheme simple and with bright colors so that the UI looks good to the user.  
The page uses semantic HTML elements, and vanilla Javascript.
